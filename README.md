### What is this repository for? ###

* The big picture: We’re developing an inventory and purchasing system for a regional franchise, our
* client. The complete software system will include an inventory management system and will control the
* point-of-sale checkout registers. Our team is responsible for the point-of-sale software, not the
* inventory system. Because of the financial, tax, and legal liability of the client, the software accuracy
* must be ensured and verified.

* User Story: Compute the net price of all the items in a customer’s shopping cart including all applicable
* discounts and taxes.
